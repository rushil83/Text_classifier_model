# Text Classifier Model


Helper file:
- load the large text file
- preprocessing of text file (`nlp stuff`)
    - lematizing
    - stemming
    - eradicating stop words
    - and etc..
for e.g. our hodor
![sfsd](https://img.memecdn.com/just-hodor_o_1013823.jpg)
- creating bag of words and word vectore feature space
- loading all our model in x,y form


Sklearn file:
- Classifier our text model using sklearn available model such as logisticregression, naivebais and etc..
- here we have also created and alternative preprocesing function such that we can evaluate which library (sklearn     or nltk) would be better to preprocess in text related model


Numpy file:
- created a simple neural network model in numpy to test our classifier model
- main purpose was to get know the math behind neural network


Tensorflow file:
-  created tensorflow neural network model consisting of 3 hidden layers unit.
